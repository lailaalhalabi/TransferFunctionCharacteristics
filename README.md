# TransferFunctionCharacteristics
 
Given the num and den parameters of a transfer function, this code will:

1. Display the transfer function, the order of it and its stability.

2. Determines the natural frequecy, damping ratio, frequency of oscillation, peak and settling time and the overshoot.

3. Display the poles & zeros of the system.

4. Determines the position, velocity and acceleration errors.

5. Display the step, ramp and parabola inputs.

6. Display the gain value of the system.
